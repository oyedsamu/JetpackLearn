## Notes

- I will be learning from different tutorials to learn several parts of Compose which I will be linking here as I proceed.
- I will be updating this project everyday for the next 30 days for a start.
- I will particularly be hoping that the direction of this project goes towards building a Media app.

## Things to play with.
- Navigation
- Scoping
- Theming
- Animations
- Testing
- Media
- Permissions
- Custom Layouts
- Firebase
- Connections and Communications (==Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi etc==)

>You are welcome to make corrections and suggestions. You are also welcome to join if you're just learning from scratch too.
However, I will advise you start with a new project and not just fork the repository. You will learn a lot more by writing the code yourself from scratch.
Also, I will be adding a lot of comment to explain what I am learning in my own words.
I will be leaving each tutorial as a standalone branch and I will also link them here.
If you see something I should probably learn, you can create an issue or send me a dm on twitter @oye_dele .
